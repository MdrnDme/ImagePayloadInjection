# Responsible Disclosure

## Introduction

This document outlines best practices for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities related to image payload injection, particularly those affecting AI image generation systems. Following these guidelines ensures that security issues are addressed properly while minimizing potential harm.

## Guiding Principles

Responsible disclosure is founded on several key principles:

1. **Do No Harm**: Research should be conducted without causing damage
2. **Prioritize Security**: The goal is to improve security, not exploit vulnerabilities
3. **Collaborate**: Work with affected parties to resolve issues
4. **Educate**: Share knowledge to prevent future vulnerabilities
5. **Respect Privacy**: Handle sensitive information appropriately

## Disclosure Timeline

When you discover a vulnerability in an AI image generation system, follow this recommended timeline:

```
Discovery Day (D+0):
- Document the vulnerability thoroughly
- Verify it can be reproduced consistently

D+1 to D+3:
- Prepare clear documentation of the issue
- Create a minimal proof of concept (if necessary)
- Identify affected parties

D+3 to D+7:
- Contact the security team of the affected organization
- Provide clear documentation of the vulnerability
- Offer to assist with verification and remediation

D+7 to D+90 (typical):
- Allow the organization time to investigate and address the issue
- Maintain communication and provide clarification if needed
- Do not publicly disclose details during this period

After Remediation:
- Coordinate public disclosure timing with the organization
- Publish findings with appropriate technical details
- Credit all involved parties appropriately
```

## Crafting a Disclosure Report

### Components of an Effective Report

A well-structured vulnerability report should include:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the issue
2. **Technical Details**: Comprehensive description of the vulnerability
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Clear instructions to verify the issue
4. **Impact Assessment**: Potential consequences of exploitation
5. **Remediation Suggestions**: Potential solutions or mitigations
6. **Supporting Materials**: Relevant code, images, or output logs

### Sample Template

```
Subject: [Confidential] Security Vulnerability Report - Image Payload Injection in [System]

--------------------------
[Detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability]

Reproduction Steps:
--------------------------
1. [Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue]
2. [Include necessary code snippets or commands]
3. [Include expected results]

--------------------------
[Recommendations for addressing the vulnerability]

About Me:
--------------------------
[Your name/handle]
[Contact information]
[Optional: brief professional background]

I am reporting this vulnerability in accordance with responsible disclosure principles. I have not and will not disclose this information publicly until you have had reasonable time to address it. I would appreciate acknowledgment of this report and would be happy to provide any additional information that might help resolve the issue.

I request a response acknowledging this report within 7 days, and I suggest a 90-day disclosure timeline before public disclosure.

Regards,
[Your Name]
```

## Communication Channels

### Preferred Contact Methods

When disclosing vulnerabilities, use these channels in order of preference:

1. **Dedicated Security Contact**: Many organizations provide security@company.com or a vulnerability reporting form
2. **Bug Bounty Programs**: If available, use established platforms like HackerOne or Bugcrowd
3. **Security PGP Key**: If provided, encrypt sensitive communications with the organization's public key
4. **General Support**: Only if no security-specific contact is available

### Secure Communication Practices

- Use encryption when sharing vulnerability details
- Avoid public channels or forums for initial disclosure
- Maintain confidentiality throughout the process
- Document all communications for your records

## Special Considerations for AI Systems

AI image generation systems present unique challenges for vulnerability disclosure:

### Multi-party Responsibility

Many AI systems involve multiple responsible parties:

```
Example Responsibility Chain:
Model Developer → API Provider → Application Developer → End User
```

In these cases, consider:
- Which party can most effectively address the vulnerability
- Whether multiple parties need to be notified
- How the fix might propagate through the chain

### Unique AI Challenges

- **Model Behavior**: Distinguishing between model limitations and security vulnerabilities
- **Prompting Techniques**: Documenting how specific prompt patterns expose vulnerabilities
- **Cross-System Application**: Whether the vulnerability affects multiple AI systems
- **Deployment Variability**: How the vulnerability might manifest differently across deployments

## After Disclosure

### Follow-up Actions

After successfully disclosing a vulnerability:

1. **Maintain Availability**: Remain available to answer questions
2. **Verify Remediation**: Test the fix when available
3. **Respect Timelines**: Honor agreed-upon publication dates
4. **Document Lessons**: Record insights for future security research
5. **Acknowledge Resolution**: Thank the organization for addressing the issue

### Public Disclosure Considerations

When publishing vulnerability details after remediation:

- Focus on educational value and defensive techniques
- Omit details that could enable harmful exploitation
- Credit the affected organization's response appropriately
- Include clear warnings about educational purpose
- Highlight positive security practices

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Legal Protections

Be aware of laws and regulations that may apply to security research:

- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the US
- Computer Misuse Act in the UK
- GDPR in Europe
- Local cybersecurity and privacy laws

### Ethical Guidelines

Follow these ethical principles in security research:

- Obtain proper authorization before testing systems
- Minimize disruption to services
- Do not access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data
- Document your methodology carefully
- Act in good faith throughout the process

## Case Study: Responsible Disclosure in Practice

### Example Scenario

```
Scenario: Discovery of a Prompt Injection Vulnerability

A security researcher discovers that a popular AI image generation service 
is vulnerable to prompt injection, allowing insertion of executable code in image metadata.

Steps Taken:
1. The researcher documents the vulnerability with examples and impact assessment
2. They identify the organization's security contact from their website
3. They send an encrypted report with clear reproduction steps
4. The organization acknowledges within 48 hours
5. They collaborate on testing and verification over the next two weeks
6. The organization deploys a fix within 45 days
7. After confirmation of the fix, they coordinate public disclosure
8. The researcher publishes a blog post focusing on defensive techniques
9. The organization credits the researcher in their security bulletin
```

### Positive Outcomes

This approach led to:
- Timely remediation of the vulnerability
- Minimal risk to end users
- Educational content for the security community
- Recognition for the researcher
- Improved security practices for the organization
